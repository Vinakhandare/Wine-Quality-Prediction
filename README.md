# Wine-Quality-Prediction

**Key Concepts and Challenges**

**Chemical Attributes** – Analyze features like density, acidity, alcohol content, and pH to predict wine quality.

**Data Analysis Libraries** – Utilize Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical operations.

**Data Visualization** – Leverage Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore patterns and relationships in the dataset.

**Learning Objectives**
  
   ✔ Understand the impact of chemical properties on wine quality.

   ✔ Gain hands-on experience with classification models in machine learning.
 
   ✔ Improve data analysis, feature selection, and model evaluation skills.
   
   ✔ Enhance visualization techniques to interpret results effectively.

# This project provides a strong foundation in classification modeling and data-driven decision-making, making it a valuable experience for those interested in predictive analytics.
